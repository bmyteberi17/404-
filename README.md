# Online Restaurant System

Handling data in a propper way is the key to success and efficiency nowdays.
With the increase of number of customers, suppliers, employees and cash flow, it is neccessary to track in an efficient way all the operations of a business. A restaurant is one of them of course, that's why we chose a project related to the online system of restaurants.

The restaurant that we are researching doesn't use a certain system but only MS-Excel to record the employee data and inventory. They have tried some desktop systems for handling daily operations but haven't found the right one yet.
They want to change this way of recording because as we know, with the increase of the business size it is impossible to continue that way.

What our project suggests is a way to automate all process of the restaurant online.
Each employee can checkin/out at the system and have his wage calculated automatically. They can also check their timesheets daily/weekly/monthly and also make complaints/suggestions to the owner/manager at the end of their shift. Every bill and calculation will be registerd by the sytem, making it easier for the manager to calculate profit, sales and tips at the end of the shift. The managers will get alerts regarding the need for supply directly from the system, so he/she can directly place orders for the suppliers. Servers and bartenders can open, edit and close their tables easily using the system, while every transaction is transparent to everyone. Each economic transaction, like employee's wages and/or bill payments for the suppliers will go directly to the economist account. In this way, the owner can track and handle in real time all operating occurring at the restaurant.
